    <p> Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K.
        Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione
        Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The
        main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become
        immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all
        wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>

        <img src="./Images/aglo.jpeg">
        <p>
            Anglo-saxon poetry was circulated orally in a preliterate society, and gathered
            at last into books over some six centuries before the Norman Conquest ended English independence.
            Against the odds some of these books survive today. This anthology of prose translations covers most
            of the surviving poetry, revealing a tradition which is outstanding among early medieval literatures
            for its sophisticated exploration of the human condition in a mutable, finite, but wonderfully
            diverse and meaning-filled world.

        <p>
            A Guide to Old English has established itself as the most thorough and most
            stimulating introduction to the language of Anglo-Saxon England. This revised edition adds ten basic
            texts, together with full notes and a comprehensive glossary, which convert the Guide into a
            self-contained course book for students beginning a study of Old English. The texts, such as
            Cynewulf and Cyneheard, the story of Caedmon and the conversion of Edwin, are those that have
            traditionally been chosen by teachers precisely becasue they offer the best introduction to the
            literature and culture of the time.

        <img src="./Images/word hoard.jpeg">

        <p>
            Designed for introductory courses in Old English, Word-Hoard offers a vocabulary of some
            2000 words drawn from the poems that beginning students normally read. Exploiting the natural
            curiosity we feel about our own language, Stephen Barney draws etymological connections, provides
            mnemonic aids, and introduces the student to cultural and literary concepts as well as words. This
            second edition of his valuable book has been completely reset in a format that improves its clarity
            and conciseness.

            <li>Beowulf:</li> A Translation and Commentary:In a note discovered among his papers, J.R.R. Tolkien claims
            to have "[put] it first into Old English".[3] However, Christopher Tolkien observes that this
            sequence of events is inconsistent with the textual evidence, since the earliest manuscript of the
            Modern English text was revised into a form that corresponds in several places to the Old English
            text, which was thus probably based on a version of the Modern English tale.[7] The Old English
            version as published is furthermore incomplete, breaking off before either of the two companions
            faces Grendel.

                England.
                She grew up in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, Wales. She loved reading and wrote her first story at the
                age of six.
                After graduating from the University of Exeter in 1986, Rowling began working for Amnesty International
                in London, England.
                magic adventure while sitting in cafés and pubs. In the early 1990s she traveled to Portugal to teach
                English as a foreign language.
                After a brief marriage and the birth of her daughter, she returned to the United Kingdom, settling in
                Edinburgh, Scotland.
                Living on public assistance between work as a French teacher, she continued to write, often on scraps of
                paper and napkins.

            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Samuel Clemens</span> was born on November 30‚ 1835 in Florida‚
                Missouri‚
                the sixth of seven children. At age 4‚ Sam and his family moved to the small
                frontier town of Hannibal‚ Missouri‚ on the banks of the Mississippi River.
                Missouri‚ at the time‚ was a fairly new state (it had gained statehood in 1821)
                and made up part of the country’s western border. It was also a state that took part in slavery.
                Sam’s father owned one enslaved person, and his uncle owned several. In fact‚ it was on his uncle’s
                farm that Sam spent many boyhood summers playing in the enslaved people’s quarters‚ listening to tall

            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leo Tolstoy</span>
                (born August 28 [September 9, New Style], 1828, Yasnaya Polyana,
                Tula province, Russian Empire—died November 7 [November 20], 1910, Astapovo, Ryazan province) was a
                Russian author,
                a master of realistic fiction and one of the world’s greatest novelists.

                Tolstoy is best known for his two longest works, War and Peace (1865–69) and
                Anna Karenina (1875–77), which are commonly regarded as among the finest novels ever written.
                War and Peace in particular seems virtually to define this form for many readers and critics.
                Among Tolstoy’s shorter works, The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886) is usually classed among the best
                examples of the novella.
                Especially during his last three decades Tolstoy also achieved world renown as a moral and religious
                teacher.
                His doctrine of nonresistance to evil had an important influence on Gandhi. Although Tolstoy’s religious
                ideas no
                longer command the respect they once did, interest in his life and personality has, if anything,
                increased over the years.
